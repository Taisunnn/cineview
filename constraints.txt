# This constraints file was automatically generated on 2024-01-16T07:06:10.475440
# via "eager-upgrade" mechanism of PIP. For the "v2-8-test" branch of Airflow.
# This variant of constraints install uses the HEAD of the branch version for 'apache-airflow' but installs
# the providers from PIP-released packages at the moment of the constraint generation.
#
# Those constraints are actually those that regular users use to install released version of Airflow.
# We also use those constraints after "apache-airflow" is released and the constraints are tagged with
# "constraints-X.Y.Z" tag to build the production image for that version.
#
# This constraints file is meant to be used only in the "apache-airflow" installation command and not
# in all subsequent pip commands. By using a constraints.txt file, we ensure that solely the Airflow
# installation step is reproducible. Subsequent pip commands may install packages that would have
# been incompatible with the constraints used in Airflow reproducible installation step. Finally, pip
# commands that might change the installed version of apache-airflow should include "apache-airflow==X.Y.Z"
# in the list of install targets to prevent Airflow accidental upgrade or downgrade.
#
# Typical installation process of airflow for Python 3.8 is (with random selection of extras and custom
# dependencies added), usually consists of two steps:
#
# 1. Reproducible installation of airflow with selected providers (note constraints are used):
#
# pip install "apache-airflow[celery,cncf.kubernetes,google,amazon,snowflake]==X.Y.Z" \
#     --constraint \
#    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-X.Y.Z/constraints-3.11.txt"
#
# 2. Installing own dependencies that are potentially not matching the constraints (note constraints are not
#    used, and apache-airflow==X.Y.Z is used to make sure there is no accidental airflow upgrade/downgrade.
#
# pip install "apache-airflow==X.Y.Z" "snowflake-connector-python[pandas]=N.M.O"
#
